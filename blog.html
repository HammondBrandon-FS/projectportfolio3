                                <p class="lead text-secondary pt-3">Air BNB gets 3 million views a day on their website. What if you could use just a portion of that publicity and make money from it? In this blog I am going to break down the Pros and the Cons of investing in an Airbnb.</p><br>
    
                                <strong class="d-none d-lg-block">You Make More Money</strong><br>
                                <p class="lead text-secondary d-none d-lg-block">The first pro is obviously the money. If you get a home in a great location that is well furnished with great photos and reviews you can pull in 2-3x the revenue a long term rental can. A good place to start would be to look at the hotel pricing in your area for comparisons. This gives you a good idea of what you can charge. Keep in mind that people are more willing to spend extra money for unique experiences, comfort, or to bring their furry friends. Spend money on important things like a nice bed and aesthetically pleasing decor and then add in some cheap or free things that will get good reviews.</p>

                                    <strong class="text-white d-none d-lg-block">Do Your Research</strong><br>
                                    <p class="text-tertiary lead d-none d-lg-block">
                                    Before you start to buy you should check an area’s crime rate. You can easily google an area’s crime rate or call the local police station to get a run down on how safe an area is. You can also find out any trends that may be currently going on. If the area has a high crime rate, or there is anything suspicious in the area, this could be a good indicator that you might want to reroute your home search to a different location. Registered sex offenders have to register themselves in a database, so you can look up how close they live to your potential home and see if that is a deal breaker for you or not. Being prepared at this step is crucial.</p>

                                    <p class="text-tertiary lead">Are you thinking of selling in today’s market? Sellers are making some huge mistakes that are costing them major money. In this blog I am going to give you all the tips to avoid these traps and walk away with the most money!</p><br>

                                    <strong class="text-white d-none d-lg-block">Skip Unnecessary Updates</strong><br>
                                    <p class="text-tertiary lead d-none d-lg-block">In today’s market, buyers are so desperate for a home that they are willing to overlook some needed updates. This  could be the ideal time for you if you are wanting to sell, but you have been holding out until you can do the upgrades. Now if your home is majorly outdated this will affect the amount you are going to get for your home, but if your home just needs a few things done I would skip them! If you set on doing a few things, then I would stick to the cheapest ones that will give you the most bang for your buck. This would be cheaper projects like painting the walls and laying down laminate flooring. These two will give you a facelift on a budget. I certainly would not take on a big under haul like completely renovating a kitchen or bathroom.  I know, those two are typically my first recommendation for sellers to complete since they increase the home value the most, but in this market it is not needed and you can still net the same amount while lowering your costs. Who doesn’t want to increase their net profit right? There are some other things cheap things you can do that will help you sell for more money and you can check that out in This blog.</p>

                                    <p class="text-tertiary lead">New is always better right? Sometimes that’s not the case? I am going to dive into the pros and cons of both new construction and typical resale homes.</p><br>

                                    <strong class="text-white d-none d-lg-block">Time Lines</strong><br>
                                    <p class="text-tertiary lead d-none d-lg-block">The first pro relates to if you need to sell your home first. Buying a new construction home can put you in a great spot because it can be timed out! Putting a contingency that you must sell your home before purchasing a typical pre-owned home can throw a wrench in your plans, especially in this market. Sellers do not like having a wild card like that on the table, especially when they are getting several offers. When you are going up against multiple offers on pre-owned homes, your offer can easily be overlooked if it contains a contingency to sell your home first. I know several of my clients are not even considering offers with these types of contingencies unless they are significantly higher than the other offers. So that could mean that you end up over paying for a resale home in one of these situations. However, this is not typically the case with new construction homes. Many of the new construction builders expect these contingencies and typically do not have issues accepting them. Plus, as of right now in September of 2021, the new construction homes in our West Georgia market are not getting into bidding wars, so that is a plus as well. If you are wanting to go with a home that has not been built yet, it is a pretty long process so that does mean that you do have a good amount of time to get your home ready to sell and go through that process without being rushed. This can be a huge benefit for many people because in this market it is such a rush to get your home listed if your other offer is accepted!</p>
